**what are Ip address?**

Here is an example of a 32-bit address in binary format: \
11000000 10101000 00000001 00011110\
192        168        1        30\


**Use CIDR Notation**

It begins with a starting IP address and is seperated by a forward slash (the '/' character) followed by a number.

``The number at the end specifies how many of the bits of the IP address are fixed.``
