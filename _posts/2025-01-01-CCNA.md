## Introduction to Networking 
### Network Communication Models


| TCP/IP Model        | OSI Model         | ---   | ---                           |
|---------------------|-------------------|-------|-------------------------------|
| Network Interface   | Physical Layer    | Media | Wires/Radio/Glass             |
|                     | Data Link Layer   | Local | Ethernet (Ethernet Mac Address)|
| Network Layer       | Network Layer     | Global | (Internet Protocol) IP        |
| Transport Layer     | Transport Layer   | Cues  | TCP                           |
| Application Layer   | Application Layer | Data  | Website/Email                 |


### Encapsulation

1. `STEP1` from application layer to transport layer - slice the document into data, add Transport layer header, which is segement.

**Segment** - A chunck of data, with Transport layer header 

```
| Source port| Destionation port| Flags | Seq# | Ack# | Payload | 

```

2. `STEP2` from transport layer to network layer - add network layer header to segement, which is 'Packet'

**Packet** - A chunk of data, with a network layer header


```
| Source IP address| Destionation IP Address| TTL | Other | Segment | 

```
3. `STEP3` from network layer to datalink layer -  add data link haeder (Ethernet Header) to packet, which is  'Frame'


**Frame** - A chunk of data, with a data link layer header

```
| Destination MAC address| Source MAC Address| Layer 3 protocal | Packet | 

```

4. `STEP4` from data link layer to physical layer -  transfer data into 0/1 signal



### Data network and Addressing
Network Interface Card 
  * Signal ->  Frame
  * Physical Layer -> Data link layer (Network Interface) 
  * Mac addresses
  * Local communication 
  * Router (Defaule Gateway) has mac addresses, one for inside (local) one for outside (public internec), Frame in local only route in local network, Frame in outside only route outside network.
  * When a local device wants to send a message to an external network (e.g., Google), the data packet is first sent to the router (default gateway). The router removes the local frame and encapsulates the packet in a new frame suitable for routing outside the local network toward Google.

## Network Layer Addressing and Subnetting
Be familiar with Binary

```
binary (11100001) -> decimal
decimal(225) -> binary

```


**Hexadecimal** - IPv4 is written in hexadecimal
Every Hexadecimal value can be recorded as 4 binary bits
4 binary bits can always be converted to a hexdecimal value


| Binary  | Decimal | Hexadecimal |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| 0000    | 0       | 0           |
| 0001    | 1       | 1           |
| 0010    | 2       | 2           |
| 0011    | 3       | 3           |
| 0100    | 4       | 4           |
| 0101    | 5       | 5           |
| 0110    | 6       | 6           |
| 0111    | 7       | 7           |
| 1000    | 8       | 8           |
| 1001    | 9       | 9           |
| 1010    | 10      | A           |
| 1011    | 11      | B           |
| 1100    | 12      | C           |
| 1101    | 13      | D           |
| 1110    | 14      | E           |
| 1111    | 15      | F           |
| 10000   | 16      | 10          |


We assign IP address to the network interface card of a device on our network. and the IP address is broken into 2 portion, i.e., `Network Portion` and `Host Portion`

**IP Address Construction** - 4 decimal numbers, each decimal number is `Octet`, each Octect contains 8 binary Bits. So, IPv4 address is always `32 bits` long

```
IPv4 Format - XX.XX.XX.XX
IPv4 Example - 203.0.113.10
IPv4 Binary - 11001011.00000000.01110001.00001010


network portion: 203.0.113
Host portion: 10 

```

**Classless Addressing** 

the subnet mask is used to identify network portion and host portion.
we're going to create a seperate number, a mask, and that mask which is our seperate number, is going to put all 1s in the corresponding bits wher we want network portion and all 0s in the host portion.

```
IPv4 Example - 203.0.113.10
IPv4 Binary - 11001011.00000000.01110001.00001010
subnet mask - 11111111 11111111 11111111 00000000

network portion: 203.0.113
Host portion: 10 

```


### Ip Address Construction
Ip address contains Network portion (like Zip Code) and Host Portion (building)

Ip Address is written with 4 decimal numbers, each decimal number is called `Octect`, and each octect contains `8` bits, so that IPv4 addresss always 32 bits long

And How do we identify the ip address Network Portion and Host Portion? 
> Ans: Subnet Mask (Classless Ip Address), 
> Put all 1s on Network Portion and all 0s on Host Portion

### IP Address Type
* Network Address 
   * identifer for a group of devices
   * network prefix
* Broadcast Address
   * identifier for all devices on a network
* Host Address
   * identifies unique device on a network
