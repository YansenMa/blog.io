I’m a software developer with a strong passion for software architecture, algorithms, and computer networking. I enjoy designing efficient systems and solving complex problems through clean, scalable code. Outside of tech, I’m deeply enthusiastic about sports—especially basketball, swimming, and boxing—which keep me balanced and driven both mentally and physically. I’m always eager to learn, improve, and take on new challenges.
